# gRPC Integration Cleanup Tasks

This document outlines the changes made to integrate with the Python backend gRPC API and identifies remaining tasks for future development.

## Completed Tasks

### Core API Integration

- [x] Updated proto definitions to match the Python backend
- [x] Regenerated Dart client code using the updated proto
- [x] Refactored `ChatGrpcClient` to use the new API
- [x] Implemented conversation ID tracking
- [x] Added methods for different message types

### Error Handling

- [x] Improved error messages for different error cases
- [x] Added comprehensive user-friendly error handling
- [x] Implemented connection testing and validation
- [x] Added fallback mechanisms for connection failures

### UI Improvements

- [x] Updated UI to handle different message types
- [x] Improved message display with better styling
- [x] Added conversation ID display in the UI
- [x] Added reset conversation functionality
- [x] Enhanced the connection status display

### Documentation

- [x] Created gRPC integration documentation
- [x] Added code comments for key functionality
- [x] Documented error handling strategies
- [x] Created cleanup tasks document

## Remaining Tasks

### Testing

- [ ] Add comprehensive integration tests with the real server
- [ ] Test all error scenarios with mocked responses
- [ ] Verify conversation management with long conversations
- [ ] Test performance with large message streams

### Feature Enhancements

- [ ] Implement more robust action/tool handling in the UI
- [ ] Add support for progress tracking and visualization
- [ ] Implement message batching for large history
- [ ] Add client-side caching for conversation history

### UI Refinements

- [ ] Add typing indicators for streaming responses
- [ ] Implement better visualization for system messages
- [ ] Add ability to copy/share conversation
- [ ] Improve mobile UI layout

### Error Handling

- [ ] Add automatic retry mechanism for transient errors
- [ ] Implement progressive backoff for reconnection attempts
- [ ] Add ability to resume conversations after disconnection
- [ ] Implement client-side message queueing during disconnection

### Performance

- [ ] Optimize message processing for large conversations
- [ ] Add pagination support for conversation history
- [ ] Implement efficient message caching
- [ ] Add background connection health monitoring

## Prioritized Next Steps

1. Complete integration testing with the real server
2. Implement action/tool handling in the UI
3. Add better progress visualization
4. Improve mobile UI layout
5. Add conversation export/sharing capability

## Known Issues

- The client may occasionally fail to reconnect after network interruption
- Very long messages may cause UI rendering issues
- Action messages need better visualization in the UI
- Conversation ID management needs more robust error recovery
