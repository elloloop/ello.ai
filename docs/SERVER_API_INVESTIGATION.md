# Server API Investigation Results

After investigating the actual gRPC server API using `grpcurl`, we've discovered that the API differs significantly from our assumptions. Here are the key findings:

## Service Definition

```protobuf
service ChatService {
  rpc Chat(stream ChatMessage) returns (stream ChatMessage);
  rpc Progress(ProgressRequest) returns (stream ProgressUpdate);
  rpc StartConversation(StartConversationRequest) returns (StartConversationResponse);
}
```

## Key Differences

1. **Bidirectional Streaming**: The `Chat` method uses bidirectional streaming (`stream ChatMessage` as both input and output), not unary request â†’ streaming response as we had assumed.

2. **Message Structure**: The message types differ from our assumptions:

   ```protobuf
   message ChatMessage {
     string message_id = 1;
     string content = 2;
     MessageType type = 3;
     repeated string available_tools = 4;
     repeated ActionRequest actions = 5;
     string conversation_id = 6;
   }

   enum MessageType {
     USER_QUERY = 0;
     ASSISTANT_RESPONSE = 1;
     ACTION_REQUEST = 2;
     ACTION_RESPONSE = 3;
   }

   message StartConversationRequest {
     string client_id = 1;
     string conversation_id = 2;
   }

   message ProgressRequest {
     string request_id = 1;
   }
   ```

## Required Changes

To properly integrate with this server, we need to:

1. Update our proto files to match the server's exact message and service definitions
2. Regenerate our client code with the updated protos
3. Modify our client implementation to use bidirectional streaming for the Chat method
4. Update our application logic to handle the different message format and flow

## Next Steps

1. Obtain complete proto definitions from the server team
2. Create a complete adapter layer to bridge between our app's data model and the server's API
3. Implement proper handling for bidirectional streaming

## Interim Solution

Until we can properly align with the server API, we should:

1. Continue using the Mock Mode as a fallback
2. Consider implementing a proxy server that can translate between our expected API and the actual server API
