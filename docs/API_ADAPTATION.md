# API Adaptation for LLM Gateway

## Current Status

We've updated the proto files and regenerated the client code, but we're still seeing the "Method not found" error. This indicates that the server at `grpc-server-4rwujpfquq-uc.a.run.app` doesn't implement the exact methods we expected.

## API Compatibility Approach

Based on the observed behavior, we need to try a different approach:

1. The server may not use method names exactly as specified in our protos
2. We may need to adapt our client to use the correct sequence of API calls

## Next Steps

1. **Investigate Actual Server API**: Use `grpcurl` to inspect the actual methods available on the server

   ```
   grpcurl -d '{}' -plaintext grpc-server-4rwujpfquq-uc.a.run.app:443 list
   ```

2. **Implement Adaptive Client**: Update our ChatGrpcClient to try different method names or sequences:

   - Try "Chat" first (our current implementation)
   - Fall back to "StartConversation" followed by "Progress" pattern if needed
   - Consider implementing a protocol detection phase during initialization

3. **Mock Mode Fallback**: Ensure the mock mode works properly for users who can't connect to the server

## Server API Mapping

| Client API                        | Server API                   | Notes                                        |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| chatStream                        | Chat                         | Direct streaming method (our primary choice) |
| startConversation + trackProgress | StartConversation + Progress | Two-step pattern (our fallback)              |

This document will be updated as we learn more about the actual server API.
