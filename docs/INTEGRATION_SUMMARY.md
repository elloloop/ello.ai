# Summary of gRPC Integration Work

## API Mismatch Discovery

After investigating the API of the llm-gateway-python gRPC server, we've discovered that there is a significant API mismatch between what our Flutter app expected and what the server actually provides:

### Expected API (Original Flutter App)

```protobuf
service ChatService {
  rpc ChatStream(ChatRequest) returns (stream ChatResponse) {}
}
```

### Actual Server API

```protobuf
service ChatService {
  rpc Chat(stream ChatMessage) returns (stream ChatMessage);
  rpc Progress(ProgressRequest) returns (stream ProgressUpdate);
  rpc StartConversation(StartConversationRequest) returns (StartConversationResponse);
}
```

The key difference is that the server uses bidirectional streaming for the Chat method, while our app expected a unary request with streaming response.

## Changes Made

1. **Updated Proto Files**: Added all methods from the server API to our proto file.
2. **Regenerated Client Code**: Used the updated proto files to regenerate the Dart client code.
3. **Improved Error Handling**: Updated the ChatGrpcClient to provide clear error messages about the API mismatch.
4. **Documentation**: Created detailed documentation files:
   - `SERVER_API_INVESTIGATION.md`: Detailing the actual server API structure
   - `API_ADAPTATION.md`: Strategies for adapting to the server API
   - `GRPC_UPDATES.md`: Summary of changes made to our app

## Current State

The app now correctly detects and reports the API mismatch to users, recommending the use of Mock Mode until a proper adapter can be implemented.

## Next Steps

To fully integrate with the llm-gateway-python server, we need to:

1. **Get Complete Proto Definitions**: Obtain the complete set of proto files from the server team.
2. **Create Bidirectional Client**: Implement a new client that supports bidirectional streaming.
3. **Build an Adapter Layer**: Create an adapter layer that translates between our app's data model and the server's API.

## Recommendations

1. **Use Mock Mode**: Until the API integration is complete, users should enable Mock Mode in the app settings.
2. **Consider Proxy Server**: Implement a proxy server that can translate between the expected and actual APIs.
3. **Update App Architecture**: Modify the app architecture to support bidirectional streaming and the different message format.

This work has given us a clear understanding of the integration challenges and a path forward to fully integrating with the llm-gateway-python server.
