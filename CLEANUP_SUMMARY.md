## Removed gRPC-Web Support

As requested, we've removed gRPC-Web support from the application and modified it to connect directly to standard gRPC services on Cloud Run, following the Google Cloud Run guide. The following changes were made:

1. **Pubspec.yaml**

   - Updated the comment for the grpc package to clarify we're using standard gRPC

2. **gRPC Client Implementation**
   - Modified `ChatGrpcClient` class to remove gRPC-Web specific code
   - Updated the connection logic to always use TLS/secure connection for Cloud Run
   - Simplified error handling for gRPC connections
   - Left a backward-compatible `initWithWeb` method that now uses standard gRPC

## Removed gRPC-Web Support

As requested, we've removed gRPC-Web support from the application and modified it to connect directly to standard gRPC services on Cloud Run, following the Google Cloud Run guide. The following changes were made:

1. **Pubspec.yaml**

   - Updated the comment for the grpc package to clarify we're using standard gRPC

2. **gRPC Client Implementation**

   - Modified `ChatGrpcClient` class to remove gRPC-Web specific code
   - Updated the connection logic to always use TLS/secure connection for Cloud Run
   - Simplified error handling for gRPC connections
   - Left a backward-compatible `initWithWeb` method that now uses standard gRPC

3. **Dependency Providers**
   - Removed `GrpcWebNotifier` class
   - Removed `useGrpcWebProvider`
   - Updated `ChatClientNotifier` to handle Cloud Run connections properly without gRPC-Web

## Connecting to Cloud Run

The app now connects to a gRPC service on Cloud Run following these best practices:

1. When a Cloud Run service is detected (URL contains "run.app"):

   - Automatically uses secure TLS connection
   - Uses port 443 by default
   - Configures appropriate timeouts for cloud connectivity

2. For standard gRPC:
   - Uses HTTP/2 as the transport protocol (required for streaming)
   - Properly handles connection retries and error messaging

## UI Changes

The Debug Settings dialog has been updated to:

- Remove the "Use gRPC-Web Compatible Mode" toggle
- Add a Cloud Run information section that appears when connecting to a run.app service
- Simplify the connection testing process

## Future Improvements

Some potential improvements for the future:

1. **Connection Handling**:

   - Add more specific error handling for different gRPC status codes
   - Implement better retry logic for intermittent connection issues

2. **Configuration**:

   - Add support for additional gRPC metadata like API keys or custom headers
   - Implement a configuration file for common gRPC endpoints

3. **Protocol Buffers**:
   - Ensure the proto definitions match the Cloud Run service exactly
   - Set up a CI/CD process to keep proto files in sync

## References

This implementation follows Google's recommended approach for connecting to gRPC services on Cloud Run:
https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/triggering/grpc

Key concepts implemented:

- Using HTTP/2 as the transport protocol
- Proper handling of TLS connections
- Listening on the PORT environment variable in the server
- Connection to port 443 for Cloud Run services
- Added detailed documentation in `/docs/GRPC_WEB_NOTES.md` explaining the compatibility approach

## Platform Compatibility

- Modified the implementation to handle differences between web and non-web platforms
- Improved the debug UI to explain the limitations and compatibility settings
- Enhanced error messages to provide better guidance on Cloud Run connectivity
- Updated test connection functionality to clarify what's being tested
